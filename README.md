# Chat-Guest
This is a chat software with channels, permissions and private channels<br>
But without saving of channel content (Not yet)<br>
Not creating log files (It logs every important to know in console (with IP Address on login))<br>
Not logging chat messages 
## Why?
That's a good question.
## Who made it?
[Felix](https://github.com/strifel), who made the server, [Robin](https://github.com/robmroi03), who made the client and [Marko](https://github.com/L3Fluffel).
## Is there any Library?
Yes and no. There is no official Library for writing e.g. chat-bots.<br>
But you can just use the files in the Client/Server Communication Directory, build it up into an jar and use it as Library for your project. Just read the documentation written to methods and look at our implementation. 
## License
We decided to use MIT License.
